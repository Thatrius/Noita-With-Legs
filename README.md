Are you tired of having a reliable movement system? Well you're in luck - Introducing, LEGS!!! Equip yourself with a pair of these bad boys 
and make standing up a challenge to reckoned with. With the help of our patented physics-based locomotion AI, you'll barely get around at all!

Now I know what you may be thinking - "This is stupid and puts me at a disadvantage". Well have no fear! Because while both these things are 
true, we also hope to spread the gift of legs to all the creatures of Noita, so that no one is safe. Except the spiders of course, they have too many 
legs for unreliable movement. Did I mention I'm adding spiders? No? Well I am.
